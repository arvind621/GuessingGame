# Guessing Game

Welcome to the **Guessing Game** project! This is a simple command-line game developed in Java where players try to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

## How It Works

- The game generates a random number within a given range.
- The player is prompted to guess the number.
- After each guess, the game provides feedback:
  - If the guess is too high, the game will prompt you to guess a lower number.
  - If the guess is too low, the game will prompt you to guess a higher number.
  - If the guess is correct, the game congratulates the player and displays the number of attempts made.
